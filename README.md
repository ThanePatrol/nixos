# Nix Dot files
Collection of files (mostly `nix`) that form a portable setup that works on NixOS and MacOS flawlessly. 
While there are some linux features and mac features that are not 1-1, the overall workflow (shortcuts, applications, etc)
is mirrored as close as possible. 

## Notable Features
- Mac and Linux setups have identical keybinds where possible, raise a issue if you notice anything!
- Tiling window managers with the same shortcuts, Hyprland on Linux, Yabai on MacOS
